# Saveory
TechTogether Boston 2020 - Virtual

Since the advent of food ordering apps, ordering food online has become more common than ever. However, home cooking is not only normally more healthy, it also saves money and decreases our carbon footprint.

There are 2 parts to Saveory: 
When people order food online (in this case, UberEats) and click on a menu item, Saveory's sidebar pops up with a recipe for a similar item, encouraging more people to cook at with a convenient recipe that matches their craving.

Users who are undecided about their next meal can also click on Saveory's chrome extension for a random recipe recommendation.
