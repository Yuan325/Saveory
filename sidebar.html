        <li>Grab the spiralizer and the zucchini and use the chipper blade. (This is one of the three blades that comes
          with the Paderno.) Use a knife to cut off both ends of the zucchini and then place it into the spiralizer.
          Turn until you have fresh zoodles.</li>
        <li>Place a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil. Place the fresh zoodles
          into the skillet and add the garlic and red pepper flakes to flavor things up. Toss zoodles in olive oil and
          season well. Cover skillet and heat for one minute. Remove lid, toss zoodles again, and cover for an
          additional two minutes. Remove from heat and keep covered.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp to a small skillet over medium-high heat in a tbsp of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper,
          lemon zest, and sprinkle with parsley. Once the shrimp are heated through, add the zucchini noodles and serve
          immediately.
